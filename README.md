## Installation

By now, the only way of installing it is building it from source or
via `cargo install kafka-topic-analyzer`. In both cases you need to
have the rust toolchain installed via [http://rustup.rs/](http://rustup.rs/).

### Dependencies

#### librdkafka
When installed from source, the binary can build librdkafka as part of the
dependency resolution process. Please see the [rdkafka-rust dependency documentation](https://github.com/fede1024/rust-rdkafka/#installation)
for the detailed requirements.

The `rdkafka-rust` dependency exports a feature flag, which enables
dynamic linking of the librdkafa dependency.

You can compile this project with `cargo build --features "dynamic_linking"`
in order to use the shared library instead of building it with the dependencies.
